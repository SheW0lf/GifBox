# React App Template
A simple template made to build frontend react apps with support for Sass.

## Use
Place all files to be served into the `src` folder. The `index.js` file is the main entry file for the app. 

## Run 
1. Run `npm install` 
2. Run `npm run dev` to start development server. 

## Notes
There is a `npm run build` command in package.json, however it has not been properly configured for bundling images properly. Until it has been fixed, it is best to treat this as a development template only. Images will still work properly in development if placed into the `img` folder.
